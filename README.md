# RFM Analysis Using Advanced Machine Learning

This project leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis to segment customers and derive actionable business insights using Python. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for data processing, visualization, and analysis.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Reads and processes customer transaction data from an Excel file.
- **RFM Calculation**: Computes Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for customer segmentation.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of customer segments for better understanding.

## Technologies Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing data insights.
- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `xlrd`: For reading Excel files.

## Outputs
RFM Metrics: A summary of customer behavior.
Visualizations: Graphical insights into customer segments.
